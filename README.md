## Welcome to my Data Analytics repo
---

In this repo you will find a collection of reports and links to dashboards I will be creating as capstone projects for the multiple courses and certifications I have done and will make in the next months. The main reason for taking all these courses and getting certified in various tools is to change careers and become a Data Analyst.
